# Data-Analysis-Project
Analyzing Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

Our goal in this project is to find app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. In this project we are working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, our task is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build by using data to understand what type of apps are likey to attract more users.

Our company makes its apps available on Google Play and in the App Store. This means that we build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads, which means that the number of users of our apps determines our revenue for any given app. The more users who see and engage with the ads, the better.
